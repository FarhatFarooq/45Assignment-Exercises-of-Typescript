// Q-20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Making a Programming Language Array
var programmingLanguage = ["Typescript", "JavaScript", "Python", "PHP"];
// Print the Message of List
console.log("List of Programming Languages List");
// Print the values of Array in the form of list
programmingLanguage.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
