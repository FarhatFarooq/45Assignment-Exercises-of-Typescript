// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
// Define Variable
var alienColor = "green";
// if(alienColor === "green"){
//     console.log("If the alien’s color is green. The player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.")
// }
// else{
//     console.log("The player just earned 10 points.")
// }
// Second Verison
if (alienColor === "yellow") {
    console.log("The alien’s color is yellow. The player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
}
else {
    console.log("Else the player earned 10 points.");
}
