// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["Wahiba", "Laiba", "Sahiqa"];
guestList.forEach(function (oneGuest) { return console.log("Salam ".concat(oneGuest, ", I'm inviting you to have dinner with me.")); });
